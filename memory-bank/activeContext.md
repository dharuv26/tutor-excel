# Active Context & Next Steps

- **Current State:** The project's homepage is functionally and visually complete based on the Figma design. The codebase is organized into a scalable structure with routing and reusable components.
- **Immediate Task:** The front-end development for the homepage is considered complete. The next phase involves planning the architecture for interactivity and data management.

- **Next Logical Steps:**
    1.  **Plan New Pages/Modals:** Define the user flow and design for the "Book Trial" and "Contact Us" actions. This will determine whether to build new page components (e.g., `/contact-us`) or modal components.
    2.  **Define Authentication Flow:** Design the UI/UX for user Login and Sign Up. This is a prerequisite for any user-specific functionality.
    3.  **API/Backend Integration Strategy:** Awaiting details on the backend. The front-end should be built with the assumption that dynamic data (like testimonials, subjects) will eventually be fetched from an API. Components should be structured to easily accommodate this switch from static data to fetched data.
    4.  **Introduce State Management:** For features like authentication, a state management solution (like React Context API or a library like Redux/Zustand) will be necessary. This needs to be planned and implemented.
